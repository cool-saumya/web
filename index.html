                <p> Building, a usually roofed and walled structure built for permanent use. 
                    Rudimentary buildings were initially constructed out of the purely functional need for a controlled
                    environment to moderate the effects of climate. 
                    These first buildings were simple dwellings. Later, buildings were constructed for other functions,
                    such as food storage and to serve as sites of ceremony.

                <p>A building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place,
                   such as a house or factory. In recent years, interest in sustainable planning and building practices has also
                   become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings and other structures.
